I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in Machine Learning and Blockchain at UdeM. My research interests include machine learning for crypto price prediction, Blockchain scalability, probabilistic security analysis of sharding-based Blockchain protocols. I have been helping [Jax.Network](https://jax.network) and [Shardus](https://shardus.com) startups in analyzing the security of their protocols.
