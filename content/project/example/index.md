In this poject, we contribute to the development of profitable trading strategies by proposing a new machine learning approach that integrates various features including technical indicators and historical data. The key contribution of the proposed approach is providing buy and sell signals with high accuracy. We evaluate the proposed approach through the analysis of several cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Avax.
